Build Trigger

       1) Build periodically :
                                * * * * * /path/to/script.sh
 In Jenkins, the "Build Periodically" option is used to trigger a job at scheduled intervals automatically. It is based on a cron expression, which defines when the job should run.

How It Works:
Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Select your job.
Click Configure → Scroll to "Build Triggers".
Check "Build periodically".
Enter a cron schedule (e.g., H 12 * * 1-5 to run at noon on weekdays).
Save the configuration.



       2) Poll SCM:
                   POLL SCM also follow the same step of crontab and POLL SCM only run when your code is updated
                    * * * * * /path/to/script.sh

How Poll SCM Works:
Jenkins checks the repository at the scheduled time.
If changes are detected, it triggers a build.
If no changes, Jenkins does nothing.
