Build Trigger

1) Build periodically :
* * * * * /path/to/script.sh
In Jenkins, the "Build Periodically" option is used to trigger a job at scheduled intervals automatically. It is based on a cron expression, which defines when the job should run.

How It Works:
Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Select your job.
Click Configure → Scroll to "Build Triggers".
Check "Build periodically".
Enter a cron schedule (e.g., H 12 * * 1-5 to run at noon on weekdays).
Save the configuration.



2) Poll SCM:
POLL SCM also follow the same step of crontab and POLL SCM only run when your code is updated
* * * * * /path/to/script.sh

How Poll SCM Works:
Jenkins checks the repository at the scheduled time.
If changes are detected, it triggers a build.
If no changes, Jenkins does nothing.


3) GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling: 
 Step1 : Enable github-webhook @jenkins build trigger

 Step2 : Go to your github Repo ===> SETTINGS =====> webhook

 payload URL:
            http://3.110.48.174:8080/github-webhook/
   http;//<JENKINS_SERVER_IP>:8080/github-webhook/


4) Build after other projects are built: 

=> Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Select your job.
=> Click Configure → Scroll to "Build Triggers".
=> Check "Build after other projects are built".
=> Enter the name of the upstream job(s) (the job that should finish before this job starts).
=> Choose when to trigger:
 *) Trigger only if the upstream job is stable (successful).
 *) Trigger even if the upstream job is unstable or failed.
=> Save the configuration.
