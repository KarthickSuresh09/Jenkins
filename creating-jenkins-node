*  First we need to setup a ssh-keygen communication with master and slave
*  We need to install java on slave machine same version of the master
*  Manage jenkins ==> Nodes ==> create a Newnode
*  We need to provide a node name and permanent agent or Copy Existing Node
*  We need to name a agent "slave" 
*  write a purpose of a agent an in descripation
*  Number of executors means how many times job need to run like a "1"
*  remote root directory means we need to provide one folder like a "/tmp"
*  labels
*  Usage : Use this node as much as a possible
*  Launch method : launch agents via ssh
    ==>  host : we need to provide a domain name or ip address 
    ==>  Credentials : click on add button jenkins
         ---> Kind : ssh username with privatekey
         ---> Scope : Global
         ---> username : enter username
         ---> privatekey : enter directly ==> key ==> click on "add" button and enter private key of the ssh

*  Host Key Verification Strategy : Manually trusted key verfication startegy
*  Availability : Keep this agent online as much as possible
